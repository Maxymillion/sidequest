## The Beginning.
Like every great story, the story starts with a boy meeting a girl. They fall madly in love and forget about the troubling politics of their relationship for just a minute. Oh I haven't told you? The boy is the son of Mason Cross the owner of CrossWorks, the leading building company in Byron. While the girl is the daughter of Bernard Dolos. Yes, from the Dolos Family, which owns more than half the casinos in the country.
Like I said, an age-old story... I will spare you the details how they met and... You know what, I will tell you because fuck you... This is my story.
It was the night of the winter solstice, my year of students (from the Rhykon Academy) had a party at the house of Mynostra family. My friends and classmates invited friends and they invited other friends. You know how these parties are, it won't take long until the sorcerers start floating shit and the bards start fucking everything that moves.
I went out into the backyard after Jayce tried to set me up with a first year with one arm. I saw something moving in the back of the yard, the creature laid down. It was a girl with a bottle of wine next to her. I walked towards her and did not recognise her, I most certainly don't know everyone in this city but I would like to think that I can recognise a citizen of Byron. It looked like she was sleeping.
I felt like a creep so I decided to walk backwards, but I forgot about the bottle of wine and I tripped. With a loud thump I fell down next to her. I half expected her to scream at me or tell me to fuck off. But she started laughing, she had a beautiful laugh. She put out her hand and she said: "My name is Katelyn". "My name is William" I said while shaking her hand. We started talking about the stars, about the other planes and it seemed like we couldn't stop talking. She was a beautiful young woman in her twenties, studying wizardry and writing. When the party ended, I walked her home. We kept talking, I don't know what was wrong with me. I wouldn't shut up and she wouldn't either. When we came up to her house, I fell silent and said sheepishly "Hope to see you soon". I turned away, she grabbed my arm and kissed me on my cheek. "See you soon Lyam" she giggled while she walked towards the door. I felt like a confused small boy when the door closed. I slowly moved away almost hitting my head on a sign. "The Dolos Family Welcomes You!".

One thing led to another, we started seeing each other. I would listen to the stories she wrote about wonderful places around the continent, those amazing stories. I would tell her every time to publish these stories she wrote. Every time she would answer that her parents would go crazy when they heard about what she wrote. She would quickly skip the subject and we would start talking about my home situation. It isn't like I had it bad at home but it wasn't great. Ever since I could talk my father was teaching me the Ins and outs of construction. He still wants me to take over when I am ready. I really don't, I want to travel. See the world, go to the mountains of Kaenon, walk across the fields of Rye and look the beautiful sky above the Nuna monastery. My dad would lock me in my room if he knew what I wanted to do, "No son of my, would go out of this city. The men of Cross will build Byron" he would say. So sad right, the son of a rich father can't follow his dreams. This is what you think but I plan on doing something about it.
Katie and I would fantasise on writing on the highest mountain called Ulysses. She would be a successful writer and master Wizard and I would be a true adventurer. We would build a house on top of this mountain and grow old there and write about all the adventures we've had. Everything she learned about writing on school she was teaching to me, as she thought it would be a good way for me to voice my frustration.
We grew closer and closer and we decided to tell our parents. My mom was happy that I've found someone, my father seemed to be faking that he was happy. Later he tried to use me to get an alliance/deal with Bernard to build his casinos, we will get to this later. So I went with her to meet her family, I was scared out of my mind. I've heard so much about the Dolos family. You would be surprised but they seemed happy to meet me. "So you must be Lyam, I've heard quite a bit about you.

If you would kindly join us for lunch?" Said her mom. I didn't correct her on calling me Lyam instead of using my name. "Will father be joining us for lunch?" Katelyn asked. "Yes, your father is already at the Pandemonium, waiting for us". I whispered to Katie "Did you tell them I was coming with you?". "Yes, I did" she whispered with a sly smile. She grabbed my hand and we were heading off to the Pandemonium.

## The Pandemonium.
So the Pandemonium, its composed of a casino, hotel and a restaurant. Let's start with the restaurant, it has a see-through floor so you can see every one play, it's one way glass and impossible to see the cards. Every restaurant has its own five- star chef with his or her own style. The restaurant even has talent nights for future composers and music enthusiasts.
The hotel, it's an exclusive hotel. It can only be used by visitors of the Pandemonium. The hotel has many services, legal and illegal ones.
Last but not least the casino itself. It's a magical experience, the casino has many different games all on their own 'worlds'. All the lost chips travel across (/ float) the ceiling, flying over the different games in different 'streams'. When a game is lost the chips fly into the stream above the table (like water streams but floating in the sky). When a game is won, the chips traveling (in the stream) above the won game fall down (for a set amount of seconds). The longer you've played the longer the chips keep falling (people believe) but remember one thing The House Always Wins.

## Welcome to the Dolos Family.
The Pandemonium in Byron is an old one, it's the second one created. There are eleven Pandemonium casinos in existence. Ten of them are in the material plane. The manager of the Byron Pandemonium is Bernard Dolos, right hand man and brother of Anthony Dolos the head of the Dolos family. I was set to meet this man, the powerful Bernard Dolos. I was dating his daughter, his only daughter. His wife seemed to like me but I wasn't ready for her husband. We were in front of the 'reserved' area of the restaurant, I opened the door and there he was. Waiting for me to give him a hand, I introduced myself "Hello sir, it's good to meet you. My name is William Cross". "So this is the boy who has stolen the heart of my daughter"

he said with a straight face. "I am only kidding, good to meet you son. I've heard and read a lot about you". "What do you mean sir?" I answered stupidly. "My daughters' stories of course." He said.
Small insight into the stories, the stories depict two traveling companions, called "Lyam and Katie Wulf". It used to be only Katie Wulf, but after we... you know became an item... She added Lyam Wulf, a man Katie had met on one of her travels. The books are always from of the perspective of Katie. She wanted to be her own woman, below every title of short stories it never said Katelyn Dolos but Katie Wulf. The name of an insignificant girl, with a big story to tell.
Back to the amazing first meeting with her father. The smart man he is, he put it all together and I totally forgot about Lyam Wulf. More importantly he trusted his daughter and supported her in following her dreams. I later found out he had setup a publishing company under the name 'Wulf Publishing'. I already loved this man for everything he was, he was the complete opposite of my father. While I was fantasising about him being my father he pulled me aside into a different room. I snapped out of my fantasy, he gave me a glass of water.
"I wanted to speak to you, personally. Without my daughter, I love her to death but this is only meant for your ears. I've heard a concerning rumour about you, that this relationship is a play to get my business". "Sir... what, I..." I stammered. "Please let me finish, I followed up on this rumour and came to the realisation that it wasn't true. I did my digging into your past and had you followed on dates with my daughter and I sincerely believe you and my daughter love each other. But your father is using you to fortify his position in the neighbourhood en proposing a collaboration on building a new wing for this casino. I want your honest opinion; do you want me to go in business with your father" he said. I was fuming, who did my father think he is. Trying to destroy the one thing dat makes my life special. "You shouldn't go in business with him sir, he uses below quality materials and makes you overpay a lot." I said it... I had betrayed my family, just by saying a few words... "Thank you for your honesty, you are the right fit for my daughter." He said. "Because I betrayed my family... Doing everything and saying everything to be with your daughter?" I said a bit louder than I wanted to filled with anger. "No because of your honesty, the Dolos personal investigator already gave me this information about the materials and the extra 'hedge payment'. You told me the truth, that takes a big man. Let's go back to the girls, we don't want to keep them waiting." He put his hand on my shoulder and opened the door, Katie looked at us and started grinning, I even saw a small tear running across her cheek.

The lunch went amazing, they were interested in my story and were super supportive of my adventuring dream. When the lunch was finished Katie went to the bathroom with her mother. I was once again alone with Bernard, I asked him "Sir, may I ask you for a favour?". "We've just met, isn't it a bit soon for you to be asking me favours. Haha I am just kidding, please go on and ask." He said kiddingly. "So, I wan't to take your daughter on trip. Going to the places she dreams about, but at this moment I don't have a job and I will not take handouts. I want to earn this trip for us. Can I work for you at the casino?"
He gave me the ones over and reached out his hand and I grabbed it. "Welcome to the Dolos Family" he said. I became his apprentice, but he started me as a cash clerk. Five years had passed in these years I've worked my way up to head-dealer (/Pit boss) but I wanted to be more. I became more and more involved with the Dolos family and left the William Cross name behind me. I am Lyam Wulf, a dealer at the Pandemonium, a friend of Bernard Dolos and the husband of Katelyn Dolos. It was a beautiful wedding, her family was there and my mom. After many successful trips to destinations like Aelham, the Ruins of Alatra and the lost city of Uyn. I was called into the office by Bernard. "Lyam thanks for coming in, hope you had a nice trip!" He said satisfied. "Yes it was amazing, you'll be able the read about it in our next book. Hahah! Did you call me in here to talk about the book?" I asked. "No, you know Mano right?" He said. "Yes" I answered. "He will be leaving us, so the night manager position has opened up and I wanted to know if you were interested. You would be my right hand man, but it's hard work and the hours are rough." He said. "I will have to discuss this with Katie but I think it won't be a problem. As I am saving money to go on a roundtrip with her around Phaemora." I said. "Thats amazing, she'll love it. By the way, how it Wulf Publishing doing?" (He gave Katelyn Wulf Publishing as a wedding gift, she is running it now). "It's been great! We've had quite a few new writers sending us their drafts and we've been reading and publishing these. We've even opened our own printing office, 'The Adventures of Katie and Lyam Wulf' are now being sold all across the continent." I said proud.
Katie approved, this made it possible for me to work at night and spend a few hours during the day at Wulf Publishing. I took the night manager position; Bernard arranged a secret party with all my friends and the Dolos family. It was truly amazing, but late in the evening Katie left. She told me she wasn't feeling well, she must have been under the weather. I wanted to go with her, go back home. But she kept saying that I deserved this night out, this party was organised for me. I came home early in the morning quite drunk and fell asleep next to her. The next morning, I heard a loud thump. I jumped out of bed, Katie had fell. I tried to get her up but she couldn't stand on her legs. I was still a bit wobbly from the over

consumption of alcohol from last night. I fell down next to her, like so many years ago. But this time she was crying instead of laughing. I tried to comfort her and carried her downstairs. After she calmed down, I went to get a doctor.
The doctor didn't know what was wrong with her, she could still feel her legs and move her feet. But she was not able to stand on her legs. The doctor couldn't do anything for her, when he left we both started crying. I was the one who told her father, he came with me to our home and started crying when she was in his arms. When she fell asleep from all the emotions, she had all over the day, Bernard and I moved into another room. I talked to him about looking for a cure and not stopping until I found one. He agreed to give me a leave of absence, he did give me a golden pin with the Dolos name on it. He told me to wear it with pride as I was one of the Dolos Family.
Bernard left defeated, when he closed the door Katie woke up. When I told her about my plan she felt proud and sad at the same time. She would only let me go if I wrote my own book for once, about my trip and what I did or did not find. She made me promise that I would watch out and send her letters.
The day of my departure Bernard showed up at our house. He told me he had a present for me and Katie. It was a really fancy box, it had a note on top and it said: "For your everlasting connection, Bernard and Julia Dolos". Katie opened the box and there they were, two metallic bracelets one for each of us. I put on the one on the left and she put on the other one. Bernard started talking "These aren't only decorative but also useful, these bracelets have been enchanted so you can switch perspectives. Katelyn can experience the amazing things you come across if you let her Lyam". We started crying of course... We hugged it out and talked about the coming weeks. When Bernard left I walked after him until we were alone, I asked him where he got these bracelets the only thing he wanted to tell me was that he got these from a contact of his from Algan.

## The Great Lyam Wulf Novel
So, this is where I am now, I am leaving my beloved Byron in search for a medicine which maybe doesn't exist for a decease I do not recognise know. I am only bringing my writing utensils, a backpack, food and [...Amulet which lets me talk to Katie...]. Wish be luck!
